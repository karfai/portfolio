WHAT?

This is an interpreter for "MG": a DSL (Domain Specific Language)
that, once upon a time, formed part of a testing framework for a mail
system that used MIME. The software uses gmime as it's MIME generating
backend. We were also using gmime for the main system so we figured
that we should fix that variable during testing.

WHY?

The purpose of this DSL was to allow programmers testing the system to
specify the content of a MIME message generated by the system in a
simplified format. At the time, we were having difficultly building
raw MIME messages by hand that had specific sub-structures we wanted
to test. Since we were largely only interested in structural elements
(headers, parts and messages), we designed the grammer of MG to
clearly outline those elements while using pregenerated context to
fill in the remainder.

WHO?

A small team of (unpaid) programmers trying to make e-mail processing
interesting. This particular part of the testing infrastructure was
written by Don Kelly (karfai@gmail.com - http://blog.strangeware.ca).

SMALL PRINT

This particular publication of MG is an entry in my (dkelly) software
portfolio. It demonstrates:

- small language (DSL) design
- C programming (with heavy reliance on glib)
- MIME processing
