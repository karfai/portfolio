The Red Queen is a fictional character who appears in Lewis Carroll's fanta=
sy novella, Through the Looking-Glass.

With a motif of Through the Looking-Glass being representations of the game=
 of chess, the Red Queen could be viewed as an antagonist in the story as s=
he is the queen for the side opposing Alice. Despite this, their initial en=
counter is a cordial one, with the Red Queen explaining the rules of Chess =
concerning promotion =E2=80=94 specifically that Alice is able to become a =
queen by starting out as a pawn and reaching the eighth square at the oppos=
ite end of the board. As a queen in the game of Chess, the Red Queen is abl=
e to move swiftly and effortlessly.

Later, in Chapter 9, she appears with the White Queen, posing a series of t=
ypical Wonderland/Looking-Glass questions ("Divide a loaf by a knife: what'=
s the answer to that?"), and then celebrating Alice's promotion from pawn t=
o queen. When that celebration goes awry, Alice turns upon the Red Queen, w=
hom she "considers as the cause of all the mischief", and shakes her until =
the queen morphs into Alice's pet kitten. In doing this, Alice presents an =
end game, awakening from the dream world of the looking glass, by both real=
izing her hallucination and symbolically "taking" the Red Queen in order to=
 checkmate the Red King.

The White Rabbit appears again and orders Alice to go back to his house and=
 fetch him his gloves and fan. Inside, she finds another bottle and drinks =
from it. Alice grows so large that she has to stick one arm out the window =
and her foot up the chimney. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, a li=
zard named Bill, to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. As Bill slid=
es down the chimney Alice kicks him out with her foot, shooting him up into=
 the sky. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to =
gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into litt=
le cakes that shrink Alice down again. She runs into the woods, where she d=
ecides that she must get back to her right size and she must find the lovel=
y garden. Suddenly Alice is confronted by a giant puppy. She picks up a sti=
ck and teases him with it until he is tired and she can run away. She comes=
 upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a caterpillar smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar questions Alice and she admits to her current identity cris=
is. He asks her to recite "You Are Old, Father William." She does so, but i=
t comes out with many errors. She insults him by saying that three inches i=
s a wretched height to be (he himself is three inches tall). The Caterpilla=
r crawls away into the grass, telling Alice that one side of the mushroom w=
ill make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks of=
f two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever=
, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon=
 mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to=
 her usual height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom t=
o reach a more appropriate height.
