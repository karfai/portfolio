WHAT?

This is a (very) simple network logging implementation. It implements
a network peer that listens for network logging traces from clients
and broadcasts those traces to listening clients.

WHY?

This was an experiment to determine the suitability of using the GNet
in a larger project. Coincidentally, it served as the basis for a new
logging system in another project.

PARTS
- libraries: ntlc and ntll which implement shared parts of the system
- ntld: a network peer that broadcasts traces
- ntl_fl: a listener that receives traces and writes them to a file
- ntl_gtk: a listener that formats traces into a Gtk UI
- tests/: simplistic testing of the base libraries

SMALL PRINT

This particular publication of NTL is an entry in my (dkelly) software
portfolio. It demonstrates:

- network programming (using gnet)
- C programming (with heavy reliance on glib)
- unit testing in C (with cmockery)
