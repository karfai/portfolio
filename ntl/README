WHAT?

This is a (very) simple network logging implementation. It implements
a network peer that listens for network logging traces from clients
and broadcasts those traces to listening clients.

WHY?

This was an experiement in learning gnet usage to determine the
suitability of the library for a larger project. Additionally, it
served as the basis for a new logging system in another project.

SMALL PRINT

This particular publication of NTL is an entry in my (dkelly) software
portfolio. It demonstrates:

- network programming (using gnet)
- C programming (with heavy reliance on glib)
